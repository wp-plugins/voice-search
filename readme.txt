== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why is there no microphone button beneath the search form? =

There could be many reasons for this:

* You're not using Safari or Chrome (check out the browser support [here](http://caniuse.com/#feat=web-speech))
* Your theme doesn't use the `get_search_form()` function properly. The plugin relies on the default search form markup
* Your theme does some CSS things that the microphone button is hidden.
